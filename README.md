# Custom-Linked-List
Creating my own implementation of the linked list data structure

A linked list is a chain of nodes that each hold a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
This strategic data structure allows us to add and remove items to the beginning of a list in constant time O(1).
My implementation is a singly linked list in which the LinkedList class itself holds a reference not only to the head, but also to the tail so that appening and prepending work in O(1) time.
This project was made to get a better understanding of the linked list data structure and to better understand how Java's default untility list may work under the hood.
