# Custom-Linked-List
Creating my own implementation of the linked list data structure.

A linked list is a chain of nodes that each hold a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
This strategic data structure allows us to add and remove items to the end of a list in constant time O(1).
My implementation is a singly linked list in which the LinkedList class itself holds a reference not only to the head, but also the tail so that appening and prepending works in O(1) time. Appended items are added to the tail whereas prepended items are added to the head.

This project was made to get a better understanding of the linked list data structure and to better understand how Java's default utility list may work under the hood. Feel free to fork this project and do anything with it.
